// THE RAIL — the whole point of the product.
//
// Every answer Co-Motion gives ends on one of five rungs. Most questions land on the
// bottom two, which is the objective: keep people managing at home and out of hospital.
// But the rail only earns trust if it reliably catches the small number of questions
// where "manage it at home" is the wrong answer and someone dies of it.
//
// So the red-flag screen below runs BEFORE the model and sets a FLOOR. index.js takes
// max(ruleFloor, modelDisposition). The model can escalate. It can never soften.
//
// That asymmetry is the safety argument, and it is enforced in code rather than in a
// prompt, because a prompt is a request and code is a guarantee.
//
// The screen is deliberately over-sensitive. A false ED referral costs a wasted evening.
// A missed septic arthritis costs a joint, and sometimes a life. Those are not
// symmetrical errors and the thresholds do not pretend they are.
//
// Nothing in this file calls a model. It must keep working with no API key.

// The five rungs. Copy rewritten after review — the old "no need to contact anyone"
// closed a door this tool has no right to close, and "a pharmacist can settle this for
// free" was quietly wrong (the advice is free; the tablets are not).
//
// `level` is shown as "3 of 5". Colour must never be the only carrier of urgency: at
// 2am, on a dimmed phone with Night Shift on, a red and an orange are the same pixel.
// The words and the number do the work; colour only confirms it.

// THE THREE QUESTIONS.
//
// The regex screen above reads what the person happened to type. That is not good
// enough on its own and we should be honest about why: someone with septic arthritis
// types "my toe is agony and I feel hot and shivery". "Shivery" is not "fever". "Feel
// hot" is not "febrile". A pattern-match over free text has unknown recall, and the
// one case it must never miss is the one where the patient doesn't know which word
// matters.
//
// So we ask. Three questions, every time, before the model sees anything. They cover
// the three things that masquerade as a musculoskeletal flare and destroy someone:
// an infected joint, a compressed spinal cord, and a severe drug reaction.
//
// "Not sure" counts as YES. A person in pain at 2am who is not sure whether they have
// a fever is a person who needs a nurse, not a language model. The asymmetry is
// deliberate: a false alarm costs a phone call, a miss costs a joint.
